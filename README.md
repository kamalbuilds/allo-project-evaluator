## Allo-Project-Evaluator: A Comprehensive Dapp for Evaluating and Managing Projects built using Allo

- This tool lets the users evaluate projects made with different strategies

### Introduction

Allo-project-evaluator is a decentralized application (Dapp) designed to help users evaluate and manage projects created using various allo strategies, such as 

- MicroGrants, 
- MicroGrantsHats, 
- MicroGrantsGovernance
- SuperFluidStrategy. 

The tool provides users with intrinsic details about a pool, its applications, allocations, and distribution, ensuring donors have faith in the projects they support. 

The Dapp also allows allocators to allocate to applications and enables users to submit their applications for specific projects.

### Features

- **Pool Details**: Users can access detailed information about a pool, including its anchor ID, owner, profile creation time, and other pools created by the same profile address.
- **Application Management**: Allocators can allocate to applications, while users can submit their applications for specific projects.
- **Profile Dashboard**: The dashboard provides a list of all the pools created by a profile address, along with the pool's details and other information about the profile.

### Usage

1. **Access the Dapp**: Navigate to the Allo-Project-Evaluator Dapp to access the pool details, application management, and profile dashboard features.
2. **Connect to a Pool**: Select the pool you want to evaluate or manage by providing the pool's anchor ID or profile address.
3. **Explore Pool Details**: Once connected to a pool, users can view the pool's intrinsic details, applications, and allocations.
4. **Allocate to Applications**: Allocators can allocate funds to specific applications within the pool.
5. **Submit Applications**: Users can submit their applications for the projects they are interested in.

### Challenges Addressed

- Providing users with a comprehensive view of project details, allocations, and distribution to build trust in the projects they support.
- Facilitating efficient allocation of funds and submission of applications for specific projects.
- Enabling users to track and manage multiple pools and their associated details.

### Future Development

- Integrate with other Strategies to expand the range of allo strategies supported.
- Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- Implement additional features to support advanced project management and tracking.

### Conclusion

Allo-project-evaluator is a valuable tool for users and allocators to evaluate and manage projects created using various allo strategies. By providing detailed information about pools, applications, and allocations, the Dapp helps build trust in the projects and facilitates efficient project management. As the tool continues to evolve, it will play an increasingly important role in the allo strategy ecosystem.
